# v0.7 to v0.8 release notes

## Major changes

* IP address management has moved to a new baseoject called IPAM. Events are
  therefore recorded for address management as you would expect.
* Addresses released on any network (including the floating network) are now
  quarantined for `IP_DELETION_HALO_DURATION` seconds after deletion before they
  can be reused. The only exception to this is if a network is heavily congested
  and an allocation attempt will fail. In that case the halo is temporarily
  reduced to 30 seconds and a warning log message is emitted.
* We no longer reset the authentication secret used to generate authentication
  tokens on install. This means tokens from before install will continue to work
  for their normal lifetime.

## Minor changes

* CI has been moved from relatively unreliable scraping of the instance serial
  console over telnet to using the Shaken Fist in-guest agent to inspect the
  state of instances for correctness.
